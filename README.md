# Immersed-Interface-Methods For Elliptic Equations
Mainly introducing the solution of elliptic equations with interface problems by the immersed interface method, considering different cases such as one-dimensional and two-dimensional, conventional jump conditions and Robin jump conditions, giving the derivation process of the corresponding numerical schemes, and finally carrying out numerical verification on the overall error order.
